## Hi, I'm Francesco 👋

Full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend architecture  
and mobile applications.

I enjoy designing systems that are clean, scalable, and easy to reason about,
with particular attention to data modeling, performance, and long-term
maintainability.

---

### 🧠 Engineering Focus

- Backend architecture with NestJS
- Authentication & session management
- Cache-first data access patterns
- Pagination, filtering, and optimized read paths
- Mobile-first product engineering

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend**
- NestJS
- PostgreSQL
- Supabase

**Mobile**
- React Native (Expo)

**State & Data**
- Zustand
- TanStack Query

**Caching & Infra**
- Redis / Upstash
- Render
- EAS

---

### 📌 Selected Work

**Authentication services**
- OTP-based authentication flows
- Session persistence and refresh handling
- First-access and onboarding logic

**Data access & pagination**
- Cursor-based and page-based pagination
- Dynamic filtering strategies
- Cache invalidation approaches

**API & backend structure**
- Clean module boundaries
- Explicit domain logic
- Scalable service design

---

### ⚙️ How I Work

- Start from data modeling before writing code
- Prefer explicit flows over hidden abstractions
- Optimize read paths before write paths
- Build systems with observability in mind
- Design for scale early, not as an afterthought
